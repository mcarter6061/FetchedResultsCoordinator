# Documentation

FetchedResultsCoordinator is an object which observes section and object changes in a Fetched Results Controller (FRC) and then applies the changes to a table or collection view that is backed by the FRC.  There is [standard boilerplate implementations](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate_Protocol/) of this code in the Apple documentation for NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate.  The FetchedResultsCoordinator uses this implementation and wraps it in an easy to integrate interface.

The most common usage is likely in a controller class which owns a `NSFetchedResultsController` and has a table or collection subview.  Instantiate the coordinator like this for a table view:

```swift
    frcCoordinator = FetchedResultsCoordinator( tableView: self.tableView!, fetchedResultsController: self.fetchedResultsController, cellConfigurator: self )
```

or for a collection view:

```swift
    frcCoordinator = FetchedResultsCoordinator( collectionView: self.collectionView!, fetchedResultsController: self.fetchedResultsController, cellConfigurator: self )
```

When you are ready to load the data call `loadData` on the coordinator and it will perform the fetch on the FRC and tell the table or collection view to reload its data.  This is used in place of the FRC `performFetch`, which should not be called directly when using the coordinator.

```swift
    frcCoordinator?.loadData()
```

After calling `loadData` all changes observed by the FRC will be reflected in the table/collection view.

### Reloading vs reconfiguring cells

The initialisation parameter `cellConfigurator` is optional.  Providing one will let the coordinator call your cell configuration code again for an updated object rather than asking the table/collection view to reload that row/cell (which may cause an undesirable animation for that row/cell).  See the sections of this document for the `SimpleTableViewDataSource` and `SimpleCollectionDataSource` for more discussion of the cell configurator protocols.

### Pausing

The coordinator has a paused boolean property, which stops observing FRC changes when set to true.  For instance when bulk loading data there may be performance problems when observing a FRC and trying to apply every update to the view.  It may be a good idea to pause the coordinator during the bulk load and then unpause it once the data is loaded and the managed object context is saved.  

To stop updates you set `coordinator.paused = true`.  The table/collection view will no longer be updated when the FRC's fetched objects are changed.  When you wish to restart observing changes set `paused = false` which will reload the data in the FRC and update the table/collection.

### FRC delegate

To observe the changes the coordinator sets itself to be the delegate of the fetchedResultsController object passed in to its initializer.  This isn't ideal as it isn't obvious that the coordinator is mutating the FRC.  Be aware that if you set the FRC's delegate to another object the coordinator will no longer be notified of data changes and it will not update the table/collection view.  Also when paused it will set the FRC's delegate to nil and when unpaused it will set it back to the coordinator.  You do not need to do anything, other than be aware that the coordinator is modifying the FRC's delegate property.

## Data Sources

There is more boilerplate code to implement `UITableViewDataSource` and `UICollectionViewDataSource` protocols when the view is backed by a `NSFetchedResultsController`.  This component supplies two basic data source objects which query the FRC in the implementation of the data source protocols.  Again the goal is to wrap up the simple biolerplate code in a easy to integrate interface.

### Table View Data Source

```swift
tableViewDataSource = SimpleTableDataSource( cellConfigurator: self, fetchedResultsController: fetchedResultsController )
tableView.dataSource = tableViewDataSource
```

The cellConfigurator object (most likely your table view controller) must conform to the `TableCellConfigurator` protocol.

```swift
public protocol TableCellConfigurator {
   
    func configureCell( cell: UITableViewCell, withManagedObject managedObject: NSManagedObject )
    
    func cellReuseIdentifierForManagedObject( managedObject: NSManagedObject ) -> String
}
```

Those two methods and hooking up a SimpleTableDataSource to your table view's dataSource is enough to get a table view up and running. Be aware that the dataSource property on `UITableView` is weak, which means you will need to hold another strong reference to it elsewhere.

`cellReuseIdentifierForManagedObject` can just return a hardcoded identifier if the table only has one prototype cell.  This must be the cell's reuse identifier in your xib / storyboard.  If the table has multiple prototype cells the method should return the reuse identifier that applies to the row for the given associated model object.  

The coordinator will use the identifier returned to dequeue cells, and it will call the cell configurator `configureCell` to give you a chance to configure the cell with the data from the object for that row.

The data source also supports table view system headers and table view indexes based on FRC section indexes.

```swift
tableViewDataSource?.systemHeaders = true
tableViewDataSource?.tableIndex = true
```
When `systemHeaders` is set the section name from the FRC will be set as the title of each section header.  When `tableIndex` is set the table view will display the section index, using the capitalized first letter of each section name in the FRC. See the subclassing notes of the NSFetchedResultsController documentation for a discussion on how to customize the section indexs.

See the Example project `ExampleTableViewController` class for an example of how to use a `SimpleTableDataSource` in a `UITableViewController` subclass.  See the `ExampleTableViewSubviewController` class for an example of how to use a `SimpleTableDataSource` in a `UIViewController` subclass that has a `UITableView` subview.

### Collection View Data Source

```swift
collectionViewDataSource = SimpleCollectionDataSource( fetchedResultsController: self.fetchedResultsController, cellConfigurator: self, supplementaryViewConfigurator: self )
```

The collection data source has two configurators, one for cells and one for supplementary views.  

```swift
@objc public protocol CollectionCellConfigurator {
    
    func configureCell( cell: UICollectionViewCell, withManagedObject managedObject: NSManagedObject )
    func cellReuseIdentifierForManagedObject( managedObject: NSManagedObject ) -> String
}

@objc public protocol CollectionViewSupplementaryViewConfigurator {
    
    func configureView( view: UICollectionReusableView, ofKind: String, atIndexPath: NSIndexPath )
    func reuseIdentifierForSupplementaryViewOfKind( kind: String, atIndexPath: NSIndexPath ) -> String
}
```

The cell configurator is just like the table view cell configurator.  The `cellReuseIdentifierForManagedObject` method can return a hardcoded identifier or different values if the collection has multiple prototype cells.  The `configureCell` method gives you the opportunity to set properties on the cell for its object.

The supplementary view configurator also works the same way, `configureView` is provided a dequeued view based on the reuse identifier returned by `reuseIdentifierForSupplementaryViewOfKind`.
